# Password Generators
# GUI version

This is my first attempt at developing a password generator with a graphical user interface. When ran a window will pop up with a single button that reads PASSWORD GENERATOR. Clicking on the button with your mouse will then generate a complex 12 character password that will inclue a mix of lower and uppercase letters, 2 special characters and 3 numbers.
